# [:construction:] .NET templates (aspnet/templating) with Bootstrap 4

Very Much In Progress. The BS 4 has landed, but not yet in your VS 2017 and there is no current plan to change this AFAIK.

Note that some content here is no longer applicable to a current aspnet/templating content (`Gulp`-ing, `Bower`-ing no more, what's up with updates folks?) before the sample is fully rewritten.

## ASP.NET 5 Bootstrap  4

This is work in progress. The template comes with assets already in place and updated, but the markup of detail pages needs a review.
